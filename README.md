# Unity Plug-In for Scene Uploading (WIP)
_**Attention:** This plug-in is still in development. Currently it is possible to upload AssetBundles to ``odl4u.ko-ld.de`` for registered users on this server._

## Download and Installation ( Build 0.0.1)
The news build of the plug-in can be downloaded [here](https://owncloud.uni-koblenz.de/owncloud/s/tApp6sxP94Y5DfY).
